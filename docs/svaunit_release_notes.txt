---------------------------------------
* Support for sequence based driving
   - Added svaunit_sequence_base class, which extends uvm_sequence.
   - Added svaunit_sequencer class, which extends uvm_virtual_sequencer, used to process a sequence.
   - Added a pointer to svaunit_sequencer into svaunit_test.
   - Added svaunit_sequence_test#(type seq_type=svaunit_sequence_base) class which extends svaunit_test,
     used to start a sequence inside its test() method.
     
* Updated API used for the setting up the infrastructure
   - Added the macro `add_test(test_or_seq_type) to create, instantiate and start a test or a sequence 
     from a test suite.
     
* API is now accessible through a wrapper class
   - Added svaunit_vpi_wrapper class, which contains all SVAUnit APIs.
   - Added a pointer to svaunit_vpi_wrapper into svaunit_test and svaunit_sequence_base.
   
* pre_test() task is now deprecated.

* Added svaunit_versions_defines.svh file which stores the svaunit version numbers.

* Support for nested interfaces
   - Update DPI-C functions to identify nested interfaces.

* Support for multiple SVA instances.
   - Added a string to svaunit_concurrent_assertion_info class to identify the SVA by it's name or by it's path.
   - Update SVAUnit APIs to identify an SVA also by it's path.
   
* UVM compliance reinforced using the Verissimo SystemVerilog Testbench Linter
   - Removed redundant code in svaunit_test and svaunit_test_suite.
